# Smile Generator

## Overview
   * As a user, you will have the ability to view random jokes and pictures. Once on the website, you will be presented with a random joke and photo. The user interface is designed so that simply clicking on a joke or a photo will randomly generate a new one.

## Features

1. Responsive Design

   * Our group designed this webpage to be fully responsive from the smallest mobile devices, to tablets, to the largest desktops to provide a consistent means to view the Smile-Generator in an enjoyable and engaging experience.

2. Dad Joke API

    * On the left side of the web application, the user can view a container with a single dad joke. Upon clicking on the container, a new joke populates.

3. Dog Photo API

    * On the right side of the web application, the user can view a container with a single dog photo. A new dog photo populates for every click the user makes onto the dog image.

4. Modal Greeting

    * For every new user to visit the web application, a greeting is presented inside a modal with a form input to get the user's name, which is to be displayed in the header.

5. Dynamic Personalized Header

    * A personalized header is presented at the top of the page to give the user a warm welcome. It uses client-side storage to form the greeting, which is able to tell whether the user has visited the site before.

6. Technologies Used

    * HTML5
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * Bootstrap
    * Google Fonts
    * VSCode
